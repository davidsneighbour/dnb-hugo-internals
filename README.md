# David's Neighbour GoHugo Component / Internals

This module replaces internal templates used by Hugo with custom ones. Internal templates of Hugo are highly opiniated and not suitable for use in a production environment of a website. These templates replace them with our own setup.

## Installing

First enable modules in your own repository:

```bash
hugo mod init github.com/username/reponame
```

Then add this module to your required modules in config.toml.

```toml
[module]
[[module.imports]]
path = "github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-internals"
```

The next time you run `hugo` it will download the latest version of the module.

## Updating

```shell
# update this module
hugo mod get -u github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-internals
# update all modules
hugo mod get -u #
```

## Configuration parameters
